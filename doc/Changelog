    the time between downs.  Fix typo in string compare in last.c.
    Patch by Thomas Hood.
  * Improve handling of IPv6 addresses in last.  Patch from Fedora.
  * Document last options in usage information, previously only
    mentioned in the manual page.
  * Add new option -F to last, to output full date string instead
    of the short form provided by default.  Patch from Olaf Dabrunz
    and SuSe.

    Srivastava, adjusted to avoid aborting if SE policy was loaded in
    the initrd with patch from Bill Nottingham and Fedora.
  * Add -c option to pidof for only matching processes with the same
    process root.  Ignore -c when not running as root.  Patch from
    Thomas Woerner and Fedora.
  * Adjust init to terminate argv0 with one 0 rather than two so that
    process name can be one character longer.  Patch by Kir Kolyshkin.
  * Make sure bootlogd exit with non-error exit code when forking of
    the child successfully.
  * Add bootlogd option -s to make it possible to control the use of
    fdatasync().  Patch from Thomas Hood.

  * Change wall to make halt include hostname in output.
  * Change killall to avoid killing init by mistake.  Patch from SuSe.
  * Change killall5 to use the exit value to report if it found any
    processes to kill.  Patch from Debian.

    some pids during shutdown.  Based on patch from Colin Watson and
    Ubuntu.
  * Add references between killall5 and pidof manual pages.  Patch from Debian.
  * Modify killall to work better with user space file system, by
    changing cwd to /proc when stopping and killing processes, and
    avoiding stat() when the value isn't used.  Also, lock process
    pages in memory to avoid paging when user processes are stopped.
    Patch from Debian and Goswin von Brederlow with changes by Kel
    Modderman.

sysvinit (2.86) cistron; urgency=low

  * Fixed up bootlogd to read /proc/cmdline. Also keep an internal
    linebuffer to process \r, \t and ^H. It is becoming useable.
  * Applied trivial OWL patches
  * Block signals in syslog(), since syslog() is not re-entrant
    (James Olin Oden <joden@malachi.lee.k12.nc.us>, redhat bug #97534)
  * Minor adjustements so that sysvinit compiles on the Hurd 
  * killall5 now skips kernel threads
  * Inittab entries with both 'S' and other runlevels were broken.
    Fix by Bryan Kadzban <bryan@kadzban.is-a-geek.net>
  * Changed initreq.h to be more flexible and forwards-compatible.
  * You can now through /dev/initctl set environment variables in
    init that will be inherited by its children. For now, only
    variables prefixed with INIT_ can be set and the maximum is
    16 variables. There's also a length limit due to the size
    of struct init_request, so it should be safe from abuse.
  * Option -P and -H to shutdown set INIT_HALT=POWERDOWN and
    INIT_HALT=HALT as environment variables as described above
  * Add "mountpoint" utility.
  * Slightly better algorithm in killall5.c:pidof()
  * Added some patches from fedora-core (halt-usage, last -t,
    sulogin-message, user-console)

sysvinit (2.85) cistron; urgency=low

  * Add IPv6 support in last(1)
  * Sulogin: even if the root password is empty, ask for a password-
    otherwise there is no way to set a timeout.
  * Removed support for ioctl.save.
  * Turned of support for /etc/initrunlvl and /var/run/initrunlvl
  * Fixed warts in dowall.c ("Dmitry V. Levin" <ldv@altlinux.org>)
  * Fix init.c::spawn(). The "f" variable was used both as file descriptor
    and waitpid(2) return code.  In certain circumstances, this leads to
    TIOCSCTTY with wrong file descriptor (Vladimir N. Oleynik).
  * Fix fd leak in sulogin (Dmitry V. Levin).
  * More error checking in all wait() calling code (Dmitry V. Levin).
  * Fix argv[] initialization in spawn() (Dmitry V. Levin).

sysvinit (2.84) cistron; urgency=low

  * Don't use /etc/initlvl interface for telinit; only use /dev/initctl,
    and give a clear error when that fails.
  * Add -i/--init command line flag to init - this tells init
    'behave as system init even if you're not PID#1'. Useful for
    testing in chroot/jail type environments.

sysvinit (2.75-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change sulogin password buffer to 128 characters.
  * Don't print control characters in dowall.c
  * Try to open getenv ("CONSOLE"), /dev/console and /dev/tty0 in order.
    For backwards compatibility when you try to boot a 2.0.x kernel
    with a linux > 2.1.70 /dev/console device.
  * Change src/Makefile for non-debian systems (mainly, RedHat)
  * Try to create /dev/initctl if not present; check every time to see
    if the dev/ino of /dev/initctl has changed and re-open it. This should
    help devfs a bit.
  * Send SIGUSR1 to init at bootup to let it re-open /dev/initctl;
    again in support of devfs.
  * Moved pidof to /bin (it's only a link to killall5 anyway)

sysvinit (2.74-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Should compile with glibc 1.99 :)
  * Change behaviour of reboot(1) and halt(1) so that the default when
    the runlevel can't be determined is to call shutdown.
  * Added re-exec patch from Al Viro (21 Feb 1998):
        'U' flag added to telinit. It forces init to re-exec itself
        (passing its state through exec, certainly).
        May be useful for smoother (heh) upgrades.
        24 Feb 1998, AV:
        did_boot made global and added to state - thanks, Miquel.
        Yet another file descriptors leak - close state pipe if
        re_exec fails.

  * Use siginterrupt, now that system calls are restarted by default.
    Main symptom was that the sulogin timeout didn't work but there
    might have been more hidden problems.
  * Kill process immidiately if turned off in inittab
  * Fixed sulogin check on tty arg.
  * Use strerror() instead of sys_errlist
  * wall now supports a '-n' option to suppress [most of] the banner.
    Debian doesn't use sysvinit's wall, but apparently Redhat does.
  * Add '-F' (forcefsck) option to shutdown
  * Close and reopen /dev/initctl on SIGUSR1 (mainly for a /dev in ram)

  * Fixed init panic'ing on empty lines in /etc/inittab
  * Changed default PATH to include /usr/local/sbin
  * Set /dev/console as controlling terminal for sysinit,bootwait,wait,powerwait
    This allows using ^C to interrupt some parts of eg the boot process.
  * Remove old symlink in /var/log/initlvl; let init check both
    /var/log and /etc itself.

  use killall5 instead of kill -1 ....
- Rewrote scripts to use this, and some general changes.
- Added SysV command line compatibility to shutdown.

2.52 30-Aug-1994
- Added `powerfailnow' keyword, for when UPS battery is low.
- Updated `last'.
- Fixed utmp handling (wrt. CLEAN_UTMP)
TODO:
* Make last compatible with GNU/BSD (long options?)
* update powerd
* remote SIGPWR broadcast? in powerd? (with priv. port)
* remote shutdown

2.50  14-Feb-1994
- Ignores unknown command line arguments.
- Modelled more after the "real" sysVinit
- Lots of changes all over the place.
  (like showing runlevel in "ps" listing, logging
   runlevel into utmp file etc)
- now using "reliable" signals instead of V7 style.
- Updated all scripts. Examples are in two directories:
  etc (normal) and etc-sysv (sysv style scripts).
- runlevel 0 = halt, 1 = single user, 6 = reboot.
- added support for serial console.
- updated Propaganda, manpages.
- added shutdown access control.

2.4  24-May-93
- Send out the official version into the world as
  SysVinit-2.4.tar.z.

2.4g 15-May-93
- Changed init to really catch SIGPWR 'cause we
  hooked up an UPS to the Linux machine. The
  keyword for catching the TreeFingerSalute is
  now "ctrlaltdel" instead of "power{wait,fail}".

2.4a 22-Apr-93
- Fixed last to reckognize BSD style wtmp logging.
- Changed init to write wtmp records that are
  SysV compliant but are also reckognized by the
  BSD last. Added a '+' option to the 'process'
  field of inittab, for getties that want to do
  their own utmp/wtmp housekeeping (kludge!).
- Now accepts a runlevel on the command line,
  and reckognizes the 'auto' argument. (Sets the
  environment variable AUTOBOOT to YES)

2.2.3 24-Mar-93
- Ripped out the 'leave' action. To difficult, and
  unneeded.
- Going single user now kills _all_ processes.
- Added '-t secs' option to all commands.
- This version is stable enough to post.

2.2 02-Mar-93
- Made wait()'s asynchronous
- Changed whole thing to one big state machine
- Now using 'pseudo levels' # & * for SYSINIT & BOOT
- Added a new type of 'action', called leave. This
  process will be executed when the system goes from a
  runlevel specified in it's runlevel field to a 
  level that's not. Nice to bring down NFS and the like.

2.1 28-Jan-93
- Fixed a bug with 'boot' and 'once'.
- Check 'initdefault' for validity.
- Reckognizes "single" as command line argument.
- Retries execvp with 'sh -c exec ..' if command
  is a shell script. (shouldn't execvp do this?)
- Added patches to use syslog if defined.

2.0 08-Dec-92
- Rewrote the code totally, so started with a new
  version number.
- Dropped Minix support, this code now is Linux - specific.
- With TEST switch on, this init & telinit can
  run standalone for test purposes.

1.3, 05-Jul-92
- Got a 386, so installed Linux. Added 'soft' reboot
  to be default under linux. Fixed some typos.

1.2, 16-Jun-92
- Bugreport from Michael Haardt ; removed deadlock
  and added 'waitpid' instead of 'wait' for SYSV.

1.1, 30-Apr-92
- Read manual wrong: there is no 'action' field called
  process, but all entries are of type process. Every
  'process' get exec'ed by /bin/sh -c 'exec command'.
- Rapidly respawning processes are caught in the act.
- _SYSV support is really Linux support,
  done by poe@daimi.aau.dk on 25-Mar-92.

 1.0, 01-Feb-92
- Initial version, very primitive for the Minix
  operating system. Required some mods. to the
  kernel.
